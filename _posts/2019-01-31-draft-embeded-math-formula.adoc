stem:[x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)]

comments :
":stem: latexmath" header enables formula interpretation
it also selects the latex syntax

"stem:[x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)]"
is the actual formula

The underlying processing is performed by :

The formula doesn't render in the editor preview but only when the post is published
